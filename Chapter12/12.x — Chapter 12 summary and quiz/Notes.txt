Compound data types - data types that can be constructed from fundamental data types
Value category - indicates whether an expression resolves to a value, a function, or an object of some kind
lvalue - an expression that evaluates to a function or an object that has an identity
rvalue - an expression that is not an l-value. This includes literals except string literals and the return values of function or operators
Reference - an alias for an existing object 
	- references can't be reseated
	- dangling references lead to undefined behavior
