Numeric Promotion - type conversion of certain narrower numeric types to certain wider numeric types that
can be processed efficiently. (char) -> (int or double)
Value-Preserving Conversion (Safe Conversion) - Every possible source value can be converted into an equal value of the destiation type

Numeric Promotion Rules
	1. Integral Promotions 
		- signed char or signed short can be converted to int
		- unsigned char, char8_t, and unsigned short can be converted to int if int can hold the entire range of the type, or unsigned int otherwise
		- If char is signed by default, it follows the signed char conversion rules above. If it is unsigned by default it follows the unsigned char conversion rules above.
		- Bool can be converted to int, with false = 0 and true = 1
	2. Floating Point Promotions - Value of type float can be converted into type double
