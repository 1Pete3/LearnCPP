Numeric Conversions
1. Converting an integral type to any other integral type (excluding integral promotions).
2. Converting a floating point type to any other floating point type (excluding floating point promotions).
3. Convering a floating point type to any integral type
4. Converting an integral type to any floating point type
5. Converting an integral type or a floating point type to a bool

Unsafe Conversion - At least one value of the source type cannot be converted into an equal value of the destination type.

3 safety categories
	1. Value-preserving conversions are safe numeric conversions where the destination type can exactly represent all possible values in the source type
	2. Reinterpretive Conversions are unsafe numeric conversions where the converted value may be different than the source value but no data is lost. Sign/unsigned conversions
	3. Lossy Conversions where data may be lost during the conversion double to int
