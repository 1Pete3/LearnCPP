Program Defined Type (User Defined Type) - A custom type that we can create for use in our own programs.
	- Enumerated types and class types (structs, classes, and unions)

Type Definition - The definition of a program-defined type
	- Type definitions are exempt from the one-definition rule

Enumeration - A compound data type where every possible value is defined as a symbolic constant

Unscoped enumerations - They put their enumerator names into the same scope as the enumeration definition itself
	- Will implicitly convert to integral values

Scoped enumerations - won't implicitly conver to integers and enumerators are only placed into the scope region of the enumeration

Struct - A program defined data type that allows us to bundle multiple variables together into a single type
