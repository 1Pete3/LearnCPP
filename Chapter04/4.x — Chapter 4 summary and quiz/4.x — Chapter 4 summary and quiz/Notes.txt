Bit - smallest unit of memory aka a binary digit
Data type - tells the compiler how to interpret the contents of memory
Void - used to indicate no type
Different types take different ammounts of memory and the ammount of memory
used may vary by machine
sizeof - can be used to return the size of a type in bytes
Signed integers - Whole numbers that are positive and negative. Watchout for int overflow + int division
Unsigned integers - only hold positive whole numbers and 0, should be avoided unless doing bit-level manipulation
Fixed-width integers - integers with guaranteed sizes but they may not exist on all architextures. 
Fast + least - Both depend on a specific machine
size_t - unsigned integral type that is used to represent the size or length of objects
Scientific notation - a shorthand way of writing lengthy numbers. 
	Significand - part before the e called significant digits
Floating point - types to hold real numbers
	Precision - how many significant digits it can represent without information loss
	Rounding error - when too many significant digits are stored in a floating point number that can't hold that much
Boolean - true and false values
Char - used to store values interpreted as ASCII characters
