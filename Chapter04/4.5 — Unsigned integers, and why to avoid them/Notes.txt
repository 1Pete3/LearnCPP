Unsigned integers are integers that can only hold non-negative whole numbers

unsigned short us;
unsigned int ui;
unsigned long ul;
unsigned long long ull;

1 byte = 8 bits
1 byte unsigned integer has a range of 0 - 255

Unsigned integer range = 0 to (2^n-1)

If a unsigned value is out of range for example 280, it is out of the 1-byte range
0-255 so 1 more than the max range (256) is used to do 280 / 256 = 1 remainder 24
and 24 is stored
