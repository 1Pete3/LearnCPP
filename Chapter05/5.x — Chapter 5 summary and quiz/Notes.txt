Constant - a value that may not be changed during the program's execution
	C++ supports 2 types of constants
	1. Named constants
	2. Literals
Named Constant - a constant value that is associated with an identifier
Literal Constant - a constant value not associated with an indentifier
Constant Variable - a variable whose value can not be changed
Type Qualifier - a keyword that is applied to a type that modifies how that type behaves
	As of C++ 23 
	1. const
	2. volatile
Constant Expression - an expression that can be evaluated at compile time aka runtime expression
Runtime Constant - a constant whose initialization value isn't known until runtime
Constexpr variable - must be a compile-time constant and initialized with a constant expression, function 
parameters cannot be constexpr
std::string -  offers an easy and safe way to deal with text strings. Expensive to initialize and copy
std::string_view - provides read-only access to an existing string without making a copy
Substring - a contiguous sequence within an existing string
