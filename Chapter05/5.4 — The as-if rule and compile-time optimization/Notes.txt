Profiler - A program that can be used to see how long various parts of the program
are taking to run and which are impacting overall performance
Optimizer - A program that optimizes another program
- Modern C++ compilers are optimizing compiler, capable of automatically optimizing your
programs
The as-if rule - the compiler can modify the program however it likes to produce more optimized
code, so long as those modifications do not affect the program's observable behavior

Compile-time evaluation
Modern C++ compilers are capable of fully or partially evaluating certain expressions
at compile-time (rather than runtime) 
compile-time evaluation - When the compiler fully or partially evaluates an expression
at compile time

Constant folding
One of the original forms of Compile-time evaluation is called constant folding
constant folding - an optimization technique where the compiler replaces expressions that have 
literal operands with the result of the expression

Constant propagation - an optimization technique where the compiler replaces variables
known to have constant values with their values. 

Dead code elimination - the compiler removes code that may be executed but has no
effect on the programs behavior

Optimization can make programs harder to debug
variables, expressions, statements, and functions may be rearranged,modified, replaced, or 
entirely removed
