Constexpr - Alwats a compile-time constant
const - the value of an object cannot be changed after initialization. The value of the initializer may be known at compile time or runtime. 
The const object can be evaluated at runtime
constexpr - the object can be used in a constant expression. The value of the initializer must be known at compile time. The constexpr 
object can be evaluated at runtime or compile time

Runtime constant use const

Term	                Definition
Compile-time constant	A value or non-modifiable object whose value must be known at compile time (e.g. literals and constexpr variables).
Constexpr	            Keyword that declares objects as compile-time constants (and functions that can be evaluated at compile-time). Informally, shorthand for “constant expression”.
Constant expression	    An expression that contains only compile-time constants and operators/functions that support compile-time evaluation.
Runtime expression	    An expression that is not a constant expression.
Runtime constant	    A value or non-modifiable object that is not a compile-time constant.
