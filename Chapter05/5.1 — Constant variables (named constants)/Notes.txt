2 types of constants
1. Named constants   - associated with an identifier aka symboloic constants
2. Literal constants - constant values that are not associated with an identifier

Types of named constants
- Constant variables
- Object like macros with substitution text
- Enumerated constants

Why to use constant variables over preprocessor macros
- Macros don't follow normal C++ scoping rules
- Macro substitution behaves differently than everything else in C++
- Harder to debug code using macros

2 types of type qualifiers
1. const
2. volatile
