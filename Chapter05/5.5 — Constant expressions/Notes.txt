C++ provides ways for us to be explicit about what parts of code we want to execute at
compile time.
Compile-time programming - the use of language features that result in compile-time 
evaluation

- Performance - Compile-time evaluation makes our programs smaller and faster
- Versatility - We can always use such code in places that require a compile-time value
- Predictability - We can have the compiler halt compliation if it determines that code 
cannot be executed at complie-time
- Quality - Detect ceratin kinds of programming errors at compile time and halt the 
build if it encounters them. Undefined behavior is not allowed at compile time

Constant expressions
Constant expression - non-empty sequence of literals, constant variables, operators and 
function calls all of which must be evaluated at compile time

An expression that is not a constant expression is often called a non-constant expression
and may be informally called a runtime expression
