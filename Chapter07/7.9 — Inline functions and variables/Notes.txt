Overhead - All the extra work that must happen to set up, facilitate and/or cleanup after some task like making a function call
Inline expansion - a process where a function call is replaced by code from the called function's definition
- Inline code can improve efficiency because the compiler can optimize the statements as constant expressions
- Inline expansion is best suited for simple short functions

Cons of inline expansion
- Causes the executable to grow larger possibly and larger executables tend to be slower
