Qualified name - a name that includes an associated scope
	std::cout // identifier cout is qualified by namespace std
	::foo     // identifier foo is qualified by the global namespace
Unqualified name - a name that does not include a scoping qualifier

Using declaration - unqualified name as an alias
	using std::cout; cout will be used as an alias for std::cout and prefered if there is a collision
Using directive - allows all identifiers in a given namespace to referenced without qualification from the scope
of the using-directive
	using namespace std; tells the compiler that all names in std should be accessible without qualification in 
	the current scope

Problems using-directives
	1. allow unqualified access to all of the names from a namespace including a lot that aren't used
	2. do not prefer names from the namespace identified by the using directive over other names
