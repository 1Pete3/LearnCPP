Using static on a local variable changes its duration from automatic to static so when it goes out of scope of the
block it is still available and destroyed at the end of a program instead
- Non-const static local variables should only be used if in your entire program and in the foreseeable future of your program,
the variable is unique and it wounldn't make sense to reset the variable
- Don't use non-const static local variables to alter the flow of the program
