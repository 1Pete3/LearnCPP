An identifier with internal linkage can be seen and used within a single translation unit, but it is not accessible from other translation units.
This means that if two source files have identically named identifiers with internal linkage,
those identifiers will be treated as independent (and do not result in an ODR violation for having duplicate definitions).

- To make a non-constant global variable internal, we use the static keyword
Internal linkage makes variables and functions only accessible within the given file
