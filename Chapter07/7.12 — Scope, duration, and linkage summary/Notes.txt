Scope Summary
An identifier’s scope determines where the identifier can be accessed within the source code.

	Block (local) scope
	- point of declaration to the end of the block in which they are declared
		- Local variables
		- Function Parameters
		- Program-defined type definitions (enums or classes) declared inside a block

	Global scope
	- Can be accessed from point of declaration to end of file
		- Global variables
		- Functions
		- Program-defined type definitions (enums or classes) declared inside a namespace or in the global scope

Duration Summary
A variable's duration determines when it is created and destroyed
	- Automatic duration are created at the point of definition and destroyed when the block they are part of is exited
		- Local variables
		- Function parameters
	- Static duration are created when the program begins and destroyed when the program ends
		- Global variables
		- Static local variables
	- Dynamic duration are created and destroyed by programmer request
		- Dynamically allocated variables

Linkage Summary
An identifier's linkage determines whether a declaration of that same identifier in a different scope refers to the same entity or not
Local variables have no linkage. Each declaration of an identifier with no linkage refers to a unique object or function

	- No linkage means another declaration of an identifier refers to a unique entity
		- Local variables
		- Program-defined type identifiers (enums or classes) declared inside a block
	- Internal linkage means a declaration of the same identifier within the same translation unit refers to the same object or function
		- Static global variables
		- Static functions
		- Const global variables
		- Unnamed namespaces and anything defined within them
	- External linkage means a declaration of the same identifier within the entire program refers to the same object or function
		- Non-static functions
		- Non-const global variables (initialized or uninitialized)
		- Extern const global variables
		- Inline const global variables
		- Namespaces
