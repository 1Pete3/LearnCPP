Scope Creep - A project's capabilities grow beyond what was originally intended at the start of the project or project phase
Software Verification - Testing whether or not the software works as expected in all cases
Unit test - A test designed to test a small portion of the code in isolation to ensure a particular behavior occurs as expected
Integration testing - Tests the integration of a bunch of units together to ensure they work properly
Code Coverage - Refers to how much of the source code is executed while testing
Statement Coverage - Refers to the percentage of statements in a program that have been exercised by testing routines
Branch Coverage - Refers to the percentage of branches that have been executed by the testing routine
Loop Coverage - If you have a loop, you should ensure it works properly when it iterates 0,1,2 times

std::cerr is an output stream (like std::cout) designed to be used for error messages
Precondition - Any condition that must always be true prior to the executation of some segment of code
Invariant - A condition that must be true while some component is executing
Postcondition - Any condition that must always be true after execution of some code
Assertion - An expression that will be true unless there is a bug in the program. C++ runtime assertions are typically implemented using the assert preprocessor micro
static_assert - An assertion that is evaluated at compile time
